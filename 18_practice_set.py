# Question 3

# A tulpe value can not be changed

# a = (1,3, 4, 6, 2, 8)
# a[0] = 45
# print(a)

# Output = TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# Question 4

# b = [2, 4, 8, 23]

# print(b[0] + b[1] + b[2] + b[3])  #adding one by one

# print(sum(b))  # direct method to add list elements

# Question 5

c = (7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9)
print(c.count(0))  #Count the number of time zero is repeated
